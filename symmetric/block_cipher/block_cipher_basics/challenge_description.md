You and your friend James are trying to send a secret message to each other. Both of you have access to the key, which you will use to encrypt and decrypt each otherâ€™s messages. You want to send the following message to James: 

**<insert msg>**

Encrypt the message to prevent other people from knowing.
  

Below is the Simple Block Cipher Key-Plaintext-Ciphertext table:
